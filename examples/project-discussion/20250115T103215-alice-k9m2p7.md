Great starting point, Lucas! I'm on board with the component-based approach.

One thing to consider: for the event-driven communication, should we use a centralized event bus or allow direct subscriptions between widgets?

Here's a quick comparison:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Central event bus | Decoupled, easy debugging | Single point of failure |
| Direct subscriptions | Flexible, no bottleneck | Tighter coupling |

I'm leaning toward a hybrid approach.
