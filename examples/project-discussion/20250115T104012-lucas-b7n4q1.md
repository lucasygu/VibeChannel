This is really coming together! Let me summarize what we've agreed on:

## Decisions Made

- **Architecture**: Component-based with self-contained widgets
- **Communication**: Hybrid event system (central bus + namespaced direct connections)
- **Loading**: Lazy loading for performance

## Next Steps

- [ ] Bob: Flesh out the EventBus implementation
- [ ] Alice: Draft the widget interface spec
- [ ] Lucas: Set up the project scaffolding

Let's reconvene tomorrow with our updates. Great discussion everyone!
