Hey team! I've been thinking about the architecture for our new widget system. Here are my initial thoughts:

1. **Component-based design** - Each widget should be self-contained
2. **Event-driven communication** - Widgets communicate via events, not direct calls
3. **Lazy loading** - Only load widgets when needed

What do you all think? Any concerns or alternative approaches?
